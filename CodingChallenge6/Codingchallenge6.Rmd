## Loops and iterations â€“ 25 pts


This assignment will help with practicing on writing and executing for loops and writing functions. It will also involve some more practice with GitHub. 
### Question 1
1.	2 pts. Regarding reproducibility, what is the main point of writing your own functions and iterations? 
### Question 2
2. 	2 pts. In your own words, describe how to write a function and a for loop in R and how they work. Give me specifics like syntax, where to write code, and how the results are returned. 



This dataset contains the population and coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the 40 most populous cities in the US, along with Auburn, AL. Your task is to create a function that calculates the distance between Auburn and each other city using the Haversine formula. To do this, you'll write a for loop that goes through each city in the dataset and computes the distance from Auburn. Detailed steps are provided below.

### Question 3
3.	2 pts. Read in the Cities.csv file from Canvas using a relative file path
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("Cities.csv", na="na") 
```
